   >>> General tips

C++98 introduced variable declaration and initialization inside a for-loop statement [previously not possible in C, where the iterator variable
should be declared and initialized before the for-loop, and remains on the memory after the for-loop, due to its declaration outside of the for-loop scope]

C++17 allows declaration and initialization of variable on an if-statement and switch-case statement, similar to a for-loop [meaning that the variable to be checked on a condition
can now be created inside of an if-statement, and will exist on the memory only on the if-statement scope, and also can be used on the remaining else-statement]

C++17 also provides a [[fallthrough]] attribute to be used on switch-case-statements, to explicitly indicate that the "break" statement was intentionally omitted


   >>> Namespaces

Namespaces are used to group together all logically-related symbols [typically done within libraries: the C++ Standard Library
defines the "std" namespace]. Large programs often includes several libraries, leading to name conflicts [e.g. 2 different libraries could define a class with the same name]
A solution for several libraries could be adding a library-specific prefix to the names, but C++ addresses all the names using namespaces
Namespaces can be created by using the "namespace" keyword, and all its symbols [functions, types and variables] will have the namespace's name automatically prefixed
[the same way the scope-resolution-operator "::" is used to find members of a class, it will be used to find symbols of a namespace]
Namespaces also have hierarchy [it's possible to create namespaces inside namespaces], and namespace symbols will hide any symbols with the same name from outter scopes

   >>> Templates

On C++, is often needed to write code that is functionally the same, but operates on different types of data
C++ Templates [known as "generic programming"] are C++ code that works with any type of data [writing the functionality with variable-type independency]
Templates can be either a Template Class or a Template Function, but not both at the same time

	   >> Template Instantiation

When a template is used with data of a particular type [template <parameter>], the compiler will generate the code needed for that type [meaning that the compiler will insert
the source code for the plugged-in class definition into the translation unit [the source-code file seen by the compiler], and then compile as part of the program]
e.g. "vector<int>" [the template container "vector" with the parameter "int"] will cause the compiler to define a class [create a new instance] that is a vector of ints
Templates only works when the compiler is able to see the full definition of the template class in the "translation unit"


   >>> Keywords

auto   - The "auto" keyword was originally used in C to specify that a local variable should be created on the stack memory,
         but in C++ it means that the compiler should deduce the variable-type based on the variable's initial value, and ignores variable qualifiers [like "const"]
         It means that the "auto" keyword avoids implicit conversions, and the compiler will use the exact type of the value to be the variable-type
         The "auto" keyword is useful on situations that it's impossible to know what variable-type is returned



   >>> Numeric Types and Literals


Decimal notation is the normal way of writing numbers [base 10]
Hexadecimal notation must have the "0x" prefix on the Hex. value [base 16]
Octal notation must have the "0" prefix on the Oct. value [base 8]
Binary notation [C++14] must have the "0b" prefix on the Bin. value [base 2]


    The size of types depends on the bit-size of the machine [32 bits or 64 bits]
char      - 8 bits
int       - 16 bits
long      - 32 bits
long long - new in C++11
string    - 320 bits
float       - 32 bits, 6 digits of precision
double      - 64 bits, 15 digits of precision
long double - 64 bits, 20 digits of precision

    C++11 introduced fixed-width integers on the <cstdint> library
Signed:  int8_t, int16_t, int32_t, int64_t
Unsigned:  uint8_t, uint16_t, uint32_t, uint64_t

The traditional string literal is an array of const char, terminated by a null character [C-style string]
On C++14, the "S" suffix can be added after closing the double quotes by "using namespace std::literals" C++14, supporting all std::string operations [like addition]


   >>> Custom Data Types

int 1D_Array[] = {3, 5, 7, 9};   // 1D Array can be initialized [and the size will be automatically calculated] or can be defined at a fixed size "int 1D_Array[4];"

int 2D_Array[2][4];   // Two-dimensional Array of 2 rows [outer-array] and 4 columns [inner-array],
                      // a 2D array is stored as a single memory block, following data order from left-to-right, top-to-bottom,
                      // and should be initialized as nested arrays using curly-braces [each array being a single row], as shown below

string 2D_Array_Names[2][4] = {
    {"Djow_00", "Djow_01", "Djow_02", "Djow_03"},   // Using a single subscript "2D_Array_Names[1]" will return a row, the outer-array
    {"Djow_10", "Djow_11", "Djow_12", "Djow_13"}    // Using two subscripts "2D_Array_Names[1][2]" will return an element of the inner-array
    };                                              // To iterate over an array, use two loops, one iterating over each row, and one inside to iterate over each column of that row
